title: Mapping The Noise From Urban Rail Transport Lines In The Greater Klang Valley Area 
---

# Abstract

The Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE) has set environmental noise 
limitations and regulation standards, which apply to railways and transit trains. The 
maximum noise and vibration levels must be adhered to avoid human discomfort. The 
objectives of this project are to analyse, evaluate, and map the train passing noise 
generated along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. The ambience and train passing noise 
around LRT train stations were measured with a Sound Level Meter and recorded in 
LAeq noise levels. Taipan-Wawasan, Taman Bahagia-Taman Paramount, and 
Gombak-Taman Melati were chosen as LRT train stations. Measurements were taken 
from 50 to 950 meters, with an increment of 150 meters. Noise maps were created 
using the Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) program. Train passing 
affects the surrounding noise level within 200 meters of train lines in the Taipan-
Wawasan station area, turning redder than the ambient noise map. In contrast, 500 
meters from train tracks in the Taman Bahagia-Taman Paramount station area turns 
more orange than the ambient noise map. Within 200 meters of train lines of Gombak-
Taman Melati, the area turns more orange than the ambient noise map. This noise 
mapping project is valuable and necessary because it demonstrates the impact of LRT 
train noise on the surrounding environment and enables researchers to investigate the 
noise pollution effects of future development plans and their surroundings and 
implement risk mitigation. Hence, related authorities must take steps to reduce the 
noise generated by LRT trains as recommended by the DOE. 

# Introduction
**1.1 Background of Study** 
In a heavily populated metropolitan area with numerous high-rise structures, noise 
pollution has been prioritised as an environmental concern (Li, Law, & Kwok, 2008). 
The definition of noise is a disturbing sound that is particularly loud or unpleasant 
(Lexico, n.d.). Global population growth increases consumption, and an expanding 
economy contributes to noise pollution. Almost 80 percent of metropolitan traffic 
noise is generated by vehicles such as trains, automobiles, buses, and motorcycles, 
which are significant noise producers in today's environment. Throughout daily life, 
noise nuisance has been a substantial source of concern because of unwanted sound, 
including ambient noise released by industrial machine activities and modes of transit, 
such as aircraft, cars, and trains (Zambrano-Monserrate & Ruano, 2019). Since 1980, 
the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognised environmental noise pollution 
as a significant public health concern, owing to a growing understanding of the 
detrimental effects of environmental noise on human health and well-being (WHO, 
2018). 

The Klang Valley, located in the centre part of the Malaysian Peninsula's west 
coast, encompasses an area of approximately 3234 km2 (Chan & Vu, 2017). The 
region consists of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, its suburbs, and the state of 
Selangor's surrounding cities and towns. It is becoming more industrialised and 
urbanised. Due to the city's expanding population, industrial areas, transportation, and 
other man-made activities, noise pollution problems exist. The severity of the noise 
pollution issue would also intensify in the upcoming years. As a growing nation 
aspiring to be developed, Malaysia seeks to preserve its capital city, green and intends 
to rank among the world's "top 20 most liveable cities" by 2020. (Jabatan Perdana 
Menteri, 2010). 
 
As a result, to meet the objectives, the government has expanded public 
transportation services in Klang Valley by building new railway lines such as the Light 
Rail Transit (LRT). The LRT system is a rail system used to transport passengers in 
metropolitan areas. The LRT Kelana Jaya Line (Line 5, formerly known as the PUTRA 
Line), as shown in Figure 1.1, comprises 37 stops and covers 46.4 kilometers between 
Gombak and Putra Heights. Unlike conventional trains that run on diesel and coal, 
LRT trains run on electricity; hence, it has a greener emission profile.

While railway transit is the most environmentally benign means of travel, it is 
unavoidable to acknowledge the noise pollution caused by trains (Shahidan, Maarof, 
Hannan, & Ali, 2017). Train noise depends on the type of train utilised, whether heavy 
or light, and the sound produced by rotation wheels on the rail tracks, contributing to 
the noise contribution (Grubliauskas et al., 2014). Grubliauskas discovered that the 
driving speed and train operation method influenced the loudness for automatic or 
manual handling. Near railway lines are residences, hospitals, and other noise-
sensitive structures. Train noise significantly degrades the quality of life for most 
residents who live in these heavily crowded cities. 
 
This project will examine the present amount of noise generated by the LRT 
Kelana Jaya Line. There is a study deficit in noise mapping for urban rail transit in 
Malaysia, notably in the Klang Valley, which could assist relevant authorities in 
implementing the noise minimization approach. The noise assessment is crucial because it is important to keep an eye on and investigate the government's acceptable 
sound level range to help with policy development for sound abatement activities (Lee 
et al., 2020).

**1.2 Problem Statement** 
Noise pollution has worsened because of the rapid growth of metropolitan regions 
and railway lines in the Klang Valley region. Malaysia operates urban rail transport 
(URT) systems such as monorails, light rail transit (LRT), and mass rapid transit 
(MRT). While these railway activities generated considerable noise as the train 
travelled along the track, they considerably reduced congestion in the Klang Valley 
area (Abdulrazza et al., 2020). Noise works as an environmental stressor, resulting in 
physiological health problems and disrupted daily activities. Excessive noise exposure 
has been demonstrated to produce discomfort, interrupt sleep, increase daily 
sleepiness, negatively impact patient outcomes and hospital staff performance, raise 
the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and reduce cognitive function in 
pupils (Basner et al., 2014). According to a study conducted in Chongqing, the noise 
at the measurement point near the light rail was over 80 dB, severely affecting the 
nearby residential buildings. The noise level was extremely high within 60 meters of 
the light rail (Zhao et al., 2020). 
 
Malaysia’s Department of Environment (DOE) has set environmental noise 
limitations and regulation standards, which apply to railways and transit trains. The 
maximum noise and vibration levels that are established must be adhered to avoid 
human discomfort. Regrettably, there has been little research on the noise level generated by URT in Malaysia. This project seeks to close this gap by measuring the 
noise generated by the LRT Kelana Jaya Line and mapping the noise data collected 
along the rail lines.

**1.3 Objectives**
The specific objectives of this project are: 
 1. To analyse and evaluate the train passing noise generated along the LRT  Kelana Jaya Line;   
2. To map the train passing noise generated along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line

**1.4 Scope of Study** 
This research will focus on the noise along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line with specific 
limitations, namely: 
1. Focusing only on the noise emitted from the above-ground portion of the LRT 
Kelana Jaya Line, which includes at-grade and elevated railway tracks; and 
2. Focusing only on areas 950 meters on either side of the LRT Kelana Jaya Line 
3. During the experiment, the ambient sounds of automobiles, construction 
equipment, aeroplanes, and emergency sirens were disregarded. 

**1.5 Thesis Outline** 
This undergraduate thesis is divided into five chapters: an overview of past research, 
a literature review, methodology, results and discussion, and a conclusion. The first 
chapter, Chapter 1, will introduce the project’s background study, the problem 
statement, objectives, and scope of the study. Chapter 2 will review previous research 
on environmental noise, urban rail transit noise, and noise mapping. The methodology 
of this project, as well as the flow of the method used to complete the project, will be 
detailed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contains the study’s results and analysis, which had 
been addressed and analysed considering the study’s objectives. The final chapter, 
Chapter 5, will conclude the entire study based on the results and whether the objective 
was met. Recommendations for further research on the topic will be made. This 
project’s societal and environmental implications will also be discussed.
