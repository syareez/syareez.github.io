LRT KLAV INNOVIA Kelana Jaya Line (KLTRANSIT WORDPRESS.COM)

The Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE) has set environmental noise 
limitations and regulation standards, which apply to railways and transit trains. The 
maximum noise and vibration levels must be adhered to avoid human discomfort. The 
objectives of this project are to analyse, evaluate, and map the train passing noise 
generated along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. The ambience and train passing noise 
around LRT train stations were measured with a Sound Level Meter and recorded in 
LAeq noise levels. Taipan-Wawasan, Taman Bahagia-Taman Paramount, and 
Gombak-Taman Melati were chosen as LRT train stations. Measurements were taken 
from 50 to 950 meters, with an increment of 150 meters. Noise maps were created 
using the Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) program. Train passing 
affects the surrounding noise level within 200 meters of train lines in the Taipan-
Wawasan station area, turning redder than the ambient noise map. In contrast, 500 
meters from train tracks in the Taman Bahagia-Taman Paramount station area turns 
more orange than the ambient noise map. Within 200 meters of train lines of Gombak-
Taman Melati, the area turns more orange than the ambient noise map. This noise 
mapping project is valuable and necessary because it demonstrates the impact of LRT 
train noise on the surrounding environment and enables researchers to investigate the 
noise pollution effects of future development plans and their surroundings and 
implement risk mitigation. Hence, related authorities must take steps to reduce the 
noise generated by LRT trains as recommended by the DOE. 

# Chapter 1: Introduction
**1.1 Background of Study** 

In a heavily populated metropolitan area with numerous high-rise structures, noise 
pollution has been prioritised as an environmental concern (Li, Law, & Kwok, 2008). 
The definition of noise is a disturbing sound that is particularly loud or unpleasant 
(Lexico, n.d.). Global population growth increases consumption, and an expanding 
economy contributes to noise pollution. Almost 80 percent of metropolitan traffic 
noise is generated by vehicles such as trains, automobiles, buses, and motorcycles, 
which are significant noise producers in today's environment. Throughout daily life, 
noise nuisance has been a substantial source of concern because of unwanted sound, 
including ambient noise released by industrial machine activities and modes of transit, 
such as aircraft, cars, and trains (Zambrano-Monserrate & Ruano, 2019). Since 1980, 
the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognised environmental noise pollution 
as a significant public health concern, owing to a growing understanding of the 
detrimental effects of environmental noise on human health and well-being (WHO, 
2018). 

The Klang Valley, located in the centre part of the Malaysian Peninsula's west 
coast, encompasses an area of approximately 3234 km2 (Chan & Vu, 2017). The 
region consists of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, its suburbs, and the state of 
Selangor's surrounding cities and towns. It is becoming more industrialised and 
urbanised. Due to the city's expanding population, industrial areas, transportation, and 
other man-made activities, noise pollution problems exist. The severity of the noise 
pollution issue would also intensify in the upcoming years. As a growing nation 
aspiring to be developed, Malaysia seeks to preserve its capital city, green and intends 
to rank among the world's "top 20 most liveable cities" by 2020. (Jabatan Perdana 
Menteri, 2010). 
 
As a result, to meet the objectives, the government has expanded public 
transportation services in Klang Valley by building new railway lines such as the Light 
Rail Transit (LRT). The LRT system is a rail system used to transport passengers in 
metropolitan areas. The LRT Kelana Jaya Line (Line 5, formerly known as the PUTRA 
Line), as shown in Figure 1.1, comprises 37 stops and covers 46.4 kilometers between 
Gombak and Putra Heights. Unlike conventional trains that run on diesel and coal, 
LRT trains run on electricity; hence, it has a greener emission profile.

Figure 1.1: The trains of LRT Kelana Jaya Line passing each other at the KL Sentral station (Aliff MR, 2020).

While railway transit is the most environmentally benign means of travel, it is 
unavoidable to acknowledge the noise pollution caused by trains (Shahidan, Maarof, 
Hannan, & Ali, 2017). Train noise depends on the type of train utilised, whether heavy 
or light, and the sound produced by rotation wheels on the rail tracks, contributing to 
the noise contribution (Grubliauskas et al., 2014). Grubliauskas discovered that the 
driving speed and train operation method influenced the loudness for automatic or 
manual handling. Near railway lines are residences, hospitals, and other noise-
sensitive structures. Train noise significantly degrades the quality of life for most 
residents who live in these heavily crowded cities. 
 
This project will examine the present amount of noise generated by the LRT 
Kelana Jaya Line. There is a study deficit in noise mapping for urban rail transit in 
Malaysia, notably in the Klang Valley, which could assist relevant authorities in 
implementing the noise minimization approach. The noise assessment is crucial because it is important to keep an eye on and investigate the government's acceptable 
sound level range to help with policy development for sound abatement activities (Lee 
et al., 2020).

**1.2 Problem Statement** 

Noise pollution has worsened because of the rapid growth of metropolitan regions 
and railway lines in the Klang Valley region. Malaysia operates urban rail transport 
(URT) systems such as monorails, light rail transit (LRT), and mass rapid transit 
(MRT). While these railway activities generated considerable noise as the train 
travelled along the track, they considerably reduced congestion in the Klang Valley 
area (Abdulrazza et al., 2020). Noise works as an environmental stressor, resulting in 
physiological health problems and disrupted daily activities. Excessive noise exposure 
has been demonstrated to produce discomfort, interrupt sleep, increase daily 
sleepiness, negatively impact patient outcomes and hospital staff performance, raise 
the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and reduce cognitive function in 
pupils (Basner et al., 2014). According to a study conducted in Chongqing, the noise 
at the measurement point near the light rail was over 80 dB, severely affecting the 
nearby residential buildings. The noise level was extremely high within 60 meters of 
the light rail (Zhao et al., 2020). 
 
Malaysia’s Department of Environment (DOE) has set environmental noise 
limitations and regulation standards, which apply to railways and transit trains. The 
maximum noise and vibration levels that are established must be adhered to avoid 
human discomfort. Regrettably, there has been little research on the noise level generated by URT in Malaysia. This project seeks to close this gap by measuring the 
noise generated by the LRT Kelana Jaya Line and mapping the noise data collected 
along the rail lines.

**1.3 Objectives**

The specific objectives of this project are: 
1. To analyse and evaluate the train passing noise generated along the LRT  Kelana Jaya Line;   
2. To map the train passing noise generated along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line

**1.4 Scope of Study** 

This research will focus on the noise along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line with specific 
limitations, namely: 
1. Focusing only on the noise emitted from the above-ground portion of the LRT 
Kelana Jaya Line, which includes at-grade and elevated railway tracks; and 
2. Focusing only on areas 950 meters on either side of the LRT Kelana Jaya Line 
3. During the experiment, the ambient sounds of automobiles, construction 
equipment, aeroplanes, and emergency sirens were disregarded. 

**1.5 Thesis Outline** 

This undergraduate thesis is divided into five chapters: an overview of past research, 
a literature review, methodology, results and discussion, and a conclusion. The first 
chapter, Chapter 1, will introduce the project’s background study, the problem 
statement, objectives, and scope of the study. Chapter 2 will review previous research 
on environmental noise, urban rail transit noise, and noise mapping. The methodology 
of this project, as well as the flow of the method used to complete the project, will be 
detailed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contains the study’s results and analysis, which had 
been addressed and analysed considering the study’s objectives. The final chapter, 
Chapter 5, will conclude the entire study based on the results and whether the objective 
was met. Recommendations for further research on the topic will be made. This 
project’s societal and environmental implications will also be discussed. 

# Chapter 2: Literature Review
**2.1 General Noise** 

In acoustics, electronics, and physics, sound and noise are used interchangeably, 
although they have distinct implications when applied to listeners. Sound is vibrations 
that travel through the air or another medium and are audible when they reach the ear 
of a person or animal (Lexico, n.d.). Meanwhile, the definition of noise is an audible 
disturbance that is exceptionally loud or unpleasant. (Lexico, n.d.). Meanwhile, in 
engineering, noise also refers to signals that change without significance over time, 
whereas sound refers to meaningful signals (Fink, 2019). Noise is measured in decibels 
on a logarithmic scale. Typical noise levels in daily life include 40 dB, which 
corresponds to a whisper at 30 cm, and 100 dB, which corresponds to the sound of a 
propeller plane at 30 meters. A gain of 1 decibel is detectable, while a gain of 10 
decibels doubles the perceived noise level. Figure 2.1 shows the typical sound level on 
the dBA scale (US OSHA, 1995). 

Figure 2.1: The typical sound level on the dBA scale (US OSHA, 1995). 
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2019), exposure 
to noise levels more than 70 decibels over an extended length of time may cause 
hearing loss. Extremely loud noises exceeding 120 decibels might cause acute ear 
damage. Otherwise, personal protective equipment such as earplugs or earmuffs were 
worn to minimise noise exposure. In Malaysia, very few studies and research have 
been conducted about noise pollution. This is because knowledge of noise pollution 
remains below average. Malaysia's progress towards becoming a developed nation by 
2020 has not, however, been devoid of environmental issues. The community's noise 
level has increased because of the community's population growth and socioeconomic 
developments. 

**2.2 Environmental Noise** 

In Malaysia, there are two main forms of noise: ambient noise and occupational 
noise. Community noise and noise irritation are connected to environmental noise 
(Leung et al., 2017; Segaran et al., 2020), while occupational noise is associated with 
noise exposure in the workplace (Jacquelyne AB et al., 2020; Abu Mansor et al., 2020). 
Noise pollution is sometimes overlooked since it cannot be seen or tasted, despite 
having negative impacts. The decibel (dB) is the environmental noise pollution unit, 
used to measure sound power, sound intensity, and sound pressure level (Kumar & 
Kumar, 2018). The Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE), Ministry of Water 
and Environment, Malaysian Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH), 
and Ministry of Human Resources are accountable for environmental and occupational 
noise. 
 
Due to the ambient noise generated by the presence of numerous people in one 
location, an urban setting is rarely fully silent (von Graevenitz, 2018). In accordance 
with Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG-11) on sustainable cities and 
communities, there is a need to investigate noise pollution in Malaysia, particularly in 
the vicinity of urban rail transit. Monitoring transportation noise for up-to-date and 
accurate information on environmental noise is essential for noise pollution 
enforcement and policy creation. The Malaysian authority stated that any train 
operation should comply with the released guidelines that need to be followed; which 
is in the range of 50 dB to 80 dB with respect to two periods; day and night (DOE, 
2019), as can be referred to in Table 2.1.  

Table 2.1: Limiting Sound Level (LAeq) for Railways Including Transits (For New 
Development and Re-Alignments) (DOE, 2019) 

| Receiving Land Use Category                         | Day Time (7.00 a.m. – 10.00 p.m.) | Night Time (10.00 p.m.– 7.00 a.m.) | Lmax (Day & Night) |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Noise Sensitive Areas Low Density Residential Areas | 60 dBA                            | 50 dBA                             | 75 dBA             |
| Suburban and Urban Residential Areas                | 65 dBA                            | 60 dBA                             | 80 dBA             |
| Commercial, Business                                | 70 dBA                            | 65 dBA                             | 80 dBA             |
| Industrial                                          | 75 dBA                            | 65 dBA                             | NA                 |

Excessive noise is defined by the Noise Exposure Regulations as a daily noise 
exposure level above 82 dB(A), a daily personal noise dosage exceeding fifty percent, 
a maximum sound pressure level exceeding 115 dB(A) at any time, or a peak sound 
pressure level surpassing 140 dB (C) (DOSH, 2019). The A-weighted Leq sound level 
is represented by dB (A), also known as decibels (A). In many applications, A-
weighting is the conventional name for A frequency-weighted sound level 
measurement over the whole audio range that correlates well with perceived loudness. 
Meanwhile, Leq is the time-averaged sound level (LAT), the sound level in decibels 
with the same total sound energy as the observed fluctuation level. A C or flat 
frequency weighting can be used to measure the peak. Using the A curve adds its time 
constant, making True Peak measurement impossible. The C-weighted peak sound 
level is given in dB as LCpeak (C). C-weighting is utilised for high-level 
measurements and peak sound pressure levels. The A-weighting curve is commonly employed for general noise measurements; however, the C-weighting curve 
corresponds with human responses to high noise levels better. (Gracey, 2021).

**2.3 Impact of Environmental Noise Pollution** 

Noise has become one of the most significant pollutants in modern cities, although 
the danger is sometimes neglected. Noise functions as an environmental stressor, 
causing physiological health difficulties that might interfere with everyday activities 
and communications. Excessive noise exposure has been linked to discomfort, sleep 
disruption, daytime drowsiness, poor patient outcomes and staff performance in 
hospitals, an increase in the prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, 
and worse cognitive performance in schoolchildren (Basner et al., 2014). The WHO 
has addressed environmental noise pollution as a public health concern since 1980, 
owing to a rising knowledge of the effects that exposure to environmental noise has 
on human health and welfare (WHO, 2018). According to recent research in Spain, 
noise pollution has surpassed air pollution as the biggest environmental risk factor in 
Barcelona (Mueller et al., 2017). 

**2.4 Urban Rail Transport in Klang Valley** 

Malaysia is on its way to become a modern country. Public transportation is one 
of the variables that might influence this condition. To fulfil this purpose, the 
Malaysian government has established and extended public rail transportation systems 
such as MRT, LRT, monorail, commuter, and Malayan Railways Limited (KTMB). 
The Klang Valley now features Malaysia's most comprehensive rail transit system, 
which will serve as the future backbone of a transportation network that delivers an efficient, dependable, economical, and environmentally friendly travel option (Kwan 
et al., 2017). As shown in Figure 2.2, nine train lines are currently being operated in 
the Klang Valley, with two upcoming train lines (MRT Putrajaya Line and LRT Shah 
Alam Line).  

Figure 2.2: Klang Valley Integrated Transit Map (Rapid KL, 2021) 

The Light Rail Transit (LRT) system is a rail system used to transport passengers 
in metropolitan areas. This research focuses on the Kelana Jaya Line LRT. The LRT 
Kelana Jaya Line is highlighted with yellow colour in Figure 2.2. The LRT Kelana 
Jaya Line (Line 5, formerly known as the PUTRA Line) comprises 37 stops and covers 
46.4 kilometers between Gombak and Putra Heights. As shown in Figure 2.3, the full 
route of the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. Malaysian authorities initially constructed the line 
in 1998 and extended it in 2016 owing to the city’s severely grid-locked highways. 
The Kelana Jaya Line transports around 329,406 passengers every day as it is one of 
the most established rail lines in the Klang Valley, contributing the highest ridership 
among all the lines (MOT, 2019). Furthermore, the LRT rail line significantly 
integrates the rail networks in Malaysia and is expected to mitigate the intense traffic 
congestion in those concerned areas. 

Figure 2.3: LRT Kelana Jaya Line route map (klia2.info, n.d.). 

**2.5 Impact of Urban Rail Transport Noise Pollution** 

Rail is often regarded as one of the most ecologically benign modes of 
transportation, having the capacity to operate with significantly reduced emission levels. However, in recent decades, it has surpassed road traffic noise as the second 
most significant form of environmental noise pollution in Europe, trailing only air 
traffic and industrial noise. An estimated 22 million individuals in Europe are exposed 
to railway noise levels of at least 55 dB(A), with 17 million exposed to levels of at 
least 50 dB(A) (Peris, 2020). Railway noise is a significant source of annoyance for 
residents living near railway tracks (Shahidan et al., 2017). According to a study 
conducted in Chongqing, the noise at the measurement point near the light rail was 
over 80 dB, severely affecting the nearby residential buildings. The noise level was 
extremely high within 60 meters of the light rail (Zhao et al., 2020). In addition, 
Muralidharan et al. (2018) found that students who live near the Bhandup railway 
station do not get enough sleep and are stressed out. 

**2.6 Noise Level Before LRT Construction** 

Previously, a study done by Yaakup et al. (2000) observed that during the years 
1998–1999, 31 percent of the region in Kuala Lumpur and Klang had a great increment 
level of generated noise as compared to 13 percent of the trend for the stated area not 
to encounter the loudness. Nevertheless, over 50 percent of the entire region is still 
maintained below the noise level, where the rural areas contribute to less noise 
production. Two factors resulting in expanding noise levels are high traffic volume 
and little effort in tree plantations. In their research, Elfaig et al. (2014) have stated 
that residential areas at Jalan Tong Shin, Bukit Bintang have been examined for noise 
quality assessment in the urban city. Noise levels recorded by Sound Level Meter 
(SLM) Type One in 2013 have measured the loudness reading within the range of 52.1 
dBA to 72.7 dBA. Noise pollution in those areas is caused by traffic volume, consisting of transportation systems and motor vehicles used, which is associated with poor urban 
planning.

Halim et al. (2017) reported that residential locations at Desa Tun Razak, Kinrara 
Court, and Taman Sentul Utama have sensed the noise reading at 75.7 dB, 74.3 dB 
and 72.1 dB accordingly. The condition happened due to severe noise pollution in 
urbanised and industrialised locations, which affected the community as it exceeded 
the permissible noise limit set by the Department of Environment. Furthermore, in 
2005, three residential areas in Bandar Sunway, Kelana Jaya, and Taman Megah in 
Petaling Jaya were selected by a researcher to measure sound in the daytime, which 
resulted in a maximum reading of 67 dB, 70 dB, and 72 dB (Yusoff & Ishak, 2005). 
The reason for having a high noise caused by traffic volume along highways in the 
sense of vehicle types used has been worsened by insufficient sound barriers due to 
specification and method usage issues to reduce the enhanced noise. 

**2.7 Noise Mapping** 

Noise mapping is graphical information to visualise the sound level with different 
colours to provide helpful information on environmental impact (Alam et al., 2017). 
The dark colour indicates a higher sound level, while the brighter colour represents a 
smaller number of decibels. The shades indicate the varying sound levels for a certain 
period addressed in urban territories (Vasilyev, 2017). Noise mapping is a valuable 
tool for delivering meaningful global and local action strategies (Klæboe et al., 2006), 
and critical points can be detected (Najah et al., 2019). As claimed by (Z. Qin & Y. 
Zhu., 2016), mapping the noise is one method to alleviate noise pollution where it has already become a severe threat to people, especially those living in big cities. Figure 
2.4 shows the noise map of the Relau residential neighbourhood, Penang, Malaysia 
(Lee et al., 2020) as an example of a noise map. 
Figure 2.4: The noise map of Relau residential neighbourhood, Penang, Malaysia. 
(a) noise map in daytime, and (b) noise map in evening. (Lee et al., 2020) 
 
As agreed by a study (Tsai et al., 2009), mapping has emerged as a powerful platform 
to demonstrate noise distribution. Tsai used this effective method to identify whether 
selected areas have disobeyed the current regulatory standard or vice versa, which 
needs to be reevaluated and necessary for further noise improvement. Thus, this 
method is done to avoid any severe effects, or else the standard itself needs to be 
reexamined in the sense of adequate input level. Alarming noise levels were 
discovered along urban rail transport tracks on noise maps in a prior study by Manoj 
Kumar et al. (2019), prompting suggestions for immediate noise reduction measures 
such as noise barriers. 

**2.8 Summary** 

This chapter defines general noise, its units, and the effects of long-term exposure 
to loud noise. The chapter discusses noise, including both ambient and occupational 
noise. It is described in greater detail to focus on environmental noise. This chapter 
also addressed the noise guidelines established by the authorities, covered standard 
noise measurement parameters, and then looked at the effects of noise pollution. Most 
of the impact is hazardous to one's health and causes disruptions. Urban rail transport 
in the Klang Valley, where public train systems are expanding, is also discussed. The 
study's train route was also discussed in this chapter. The following section of this 
chapter discusses the effect of urban rail noise pollution on railway noise. The railway 
noise is a significant source of annoyance and health risks. Before construction, there 
was enough noise to be concerned about how the LRT's operation would affect the 
surrounding area. The impact of urban rail transportation noise on this study will be 
assessed using noise mapping. 

# Chapter 3: Methodology
**3.1 Overview** 

This chapter describes the approach chosen to conduct this study regarding 
research flow, site location, and research instrument. Following a review of various 
past research projects, the technique and study approach for conducting the project 
was developed and outlined. This chapter also goes over data collection and data 
analysis. 
 
**3.2 Flow Chart** 

The research flow chart is depicted in Figure 3.1. The flow chart provides a 
concise explanation from the start of the study to a decisive conclusion. The problem 
statement identifies the organised specifics on how to conduct the study so that the 
research does not diverge from the initial purpose. 

Figure 3.1: The research flow chart

**3.3 Research Approach** 

**3.3.1 Research Flow** 

According to Figure 3.1, the research flow begins with conducting a literature 
review on studies linked to this subject. A literature review is essential since it aids in 
identifying and concentrating on issues that have not yet been researched previously 
and selecting the most appropriate technique and method for doing the study. 
Following that, before delving deeper into the project, it is necessary to address the 
project problem statements and objectives before beginning the project. It guarantees 
that the project remains on track and does not deviate from its original course. As a 
result, a pilot test was designed to simulate the entire and comprehensive data 
collection. This strategy aids in the analysis and improvement of the flaws that the 
researcher encountered throughout the whole data collection process. Based on the 
encountered issues, finalised measured parameters and variables were established to 
make data collecting easier. After that, a thorough data collection process was 
conducted. The measured and recorded noise data were subjected to further 
examination. The researcher utilised the noise data for noise mapping. Consider the 
following scenario: the objectives are not addressed after the analysis. In that situation, 
the data-gathering process will be repeated with modifications to the parameters and 
variables to reach the desired result. After then, if the objectives are met, the outcomes 
are reported. 

**3.3.2 Site Location** 

This research is focused on the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. The LRT is well-known 
and serves as the primary urban rail transportation line in the greater Klang Valley 
area. It is a popular means of transportation for commuters in Kuala Lumpur. The 
service is an alternative to driving, which can be congested at times (MOT, 2019). 
Figures 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 depict the locations of the train stations involved in the data 
collection for this research.

Figure 3.2: Taipan–Wawasan LRT station pair 

Figure 3.3: Taman Bahagia–Taman Paramount LRT station pair

Figure 3.4: Gombak–Taman Melati LRT station pair 
 
 The first station is the Taipan–Wawasan station pair, the second, the Taman 
Bahagia–Taman Paramount stations pair, and lastly, the Gombak–Taman Melati 
stations pair. This research chose these stations because they are close to the residential 
areas. Residents must know the maximum amount of noise they are exposed to avoid 
further harm to their health (Azeez et al., 2005). Noise monitoring is avoided within a 
500-meter radius of an LRT station because no research has been conducted in 
Malaysia on the effect of noise levels on inhabitants living along the rail line. The 
research on noise levels along the rail line is critical. Noise and vibration caused by 
increasing train movements, prolonged rail operating hours, and development along 
transportation corridors have a negative impact on rail line inhabitants (EPA NSW, 
2013). The data collection points for each station pair have also been identified with 
their respective coordinates. 

**3.3.3 Noise measuring parameters** 

The noise levels of the ambience and when the train passes around the LRT train 
stations were collected and analysed in LAeq noise levels. Noise levels rise as a train 
arrives and fall as it passes, resulting in short-term changes in noise levels (Selamat & 
Rahim, 2018). The noise levels LAeq were measured following the Occupational 
Safety and Health (Noise Exposure) Regulations 2019 (DOSH, 2019). The radius 
range of noise data from the LRT train stations pair were measured at 50 meters, 200 
meters, 350 meters, 500 meters, 650 meters, 800 meters, and 950 meters. The noise 
levels were measured for one minute, then this study calculated the average noise 
findings after collecting data at the exact location three (3) times to achieve a better and more precise value. The noise data was collected during the day, between 7:00 
a.m. and 7:00 p.m., considering that the most active hours have the most significant 
impact on the noise level. On the other hand, nighttime would not ultimately provide 
considerable value in noise reading. People usually go back to their homes after 
working long hours and going to events outside their homes (Abdullah, 2020).

**3.4 Data Collection** 

For this study, a SLM from SVANTEK Model 971 was used to measure the 
LAeq along the specified stretch of the LRT Kelana Jaya Line, as shown in Figure 3.5. 
This research equipment was chosen as an instrument owned by the Department of 
Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra 
Malaysia (UPM), to compute noise measurement accurately. An acoustic 
measurement can be made using SLM to analyse sound levels based on the sound 
pressure collected from the noise source (NTI, 2018). The specs of the Svantek Model 
971 SLM used to measure and record train noise are shown in Table 3.1. 

Figure 3.5: Sound Level Meter (Svantek Model 971) (Svantek, 2020)

Table 3.1: The specifications of the Svantek Model 971 SLM (Svantek, 2020) 

Aside from that, the benefits of employing SLM are that it is portable, allowing 
for better handling while measuring noise. (Das et al., 2019). Furthermore, (Pathak et 
al., 2008) stated in their research that the SLM could measure sound like that of the 
human ear, hence contributing to the consistent noise level assessment. A calibrated 
sound level meter is essential for confirming any computation to get an accurate 
measurement and conform to the standard in question (Dwisetyo et al., 2021). So, this 
SLM had been calibrated before collecting data to ensure that the measurements were 
correct. 
 
According to the DOE (2019), the microphone placements for detecting train 
noise levels must be at least 1.2 meters above the ground and at least 3.5 meters away 
from any reflecting surfaces other than the ground. The microphone must be positioned 
to respond to incident sounds from rail tracks or viaducts. As shown in Figure 3.6, the 
SLM was set on a tripod per the guidelines stated by the DOE to produce a uniform 
reading in the vertical range. The windscreen that came with the SLM was used to 
keep noise levels from being affected by the wind. Extraneous noise events at the measurement location that is non-train related were identified and recorded as events 
that may have influenced the measured noise levels.

**3.5 Data Analysis and Mapping** 

After collecting the raw data from the noise measurement, data analysis was 
performed to convert the information into noise contour mapping activity. A noise map 
depicts the distribution of sound levels and the propagation of sound waves in a 
specific area over time. Noise maps allow for the study of the status of the noise 
pollution problem and are also helpful in determining the success of noise abatement 
methods. Different colours from the map's colour contour are employed (dB) to depict 
the LRT's noise bands (Sommerhoff et al., 2004). The colour indicator becomes darker 
as the noise value increases; hence, a lower noise value shows a brighter colour code, 
corresponding to a lower sound reading in decibel units (Selamat & Rahim, 2018). The 
colour code in Table 3.2 serves as a guide for the coloured noise maps. The colour will 
darken as the noise level sign rises above 55 decibels (dB). Meanwhile, the colour indicator becomes brighter and greener for 55 dB or less noise levels, showing that the 
surrounding noise level is safe.

This project utitlised the Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) to 
provide users with an interactive visualisation. Aside from that, this application offers 
good imagination for researchers to sketch parameters on the map coordinates based 
on the actual site engaged in their research field. The QGIS programme proved to be 
a helpful tool for making maps from geographical and non-spatial data. Because it is 
user-friendly and open-source, QGIS is an effective tool for creating noise maps (Vilas 
et al., 2018). 

# Chapter 4: Results and Discussion
**4.1 Overview** 

This chapter describes the results of the noise generated by LRT trains along the 
selected route of the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. The noise was measured at various 
distances from the tracks between the Taipan – Wawasan, Taman Bahagia – Taman 
Paramount, and Gombak – Taman Melati LRT Stations. The results of the noise 
measurements and noise mapping were thoroughly discussed throughout this chapter. 
Appendix A contains the full tabulated noise measurements. 

**4.2 Noise Measurement Results** 

Noise measurements were taken using Svantek 971 sound level meter equipment, 
and average values were calculated for each ambience and train passing noise. Each 
noise measuring point was subjected to six noise measurements. For instance, six noise 
measurements were taken at the Quadrant 1 650-meter point; the same was true for 
other points. Each quadrant's noise measurements were tabulated, including ambience 
noise, train passing noise, and noise level difference. The difference in noise level is calculated by subtracting ambient and train passing noise at their respective distances 
to observe the increase in noise level when the train passes compared to ambient noise. 

Furthermore, the noise measurements' standard deviations were calculated to 
observe the difference between the mean value from each noise produced to ensure 
that the data is clustered closely around the mean, implying more reliable data were 
obtained. The average standard deviations of the noise measurements are 1.9 dBA, 
indicating that the noise measurement is very close to the average reading. The 
standard deviation values for each noise measuring point are shown in Appendix C.1. 
Further research should take more noise measurements to obtain more accurate 
average readings and lower standard deviation values. Using a more sensitive sound 
level meter contributes to the accuracy and consistency of noise measurements. The 
ambient noise level fluctuates, possibly due to other obtrusive noise sources. 
Motorcycles, heavy trucks or lorries, aeroplanes, machine sounds from construction 
sites, honking and exhaust sound from vehicles, and machine sounds from construction 
sites have been identified as the most annoying noise sources. 
 
The noise levels recorded at each track segment vary due to the design and 
surrounding area of the railway tracks and other factors that affect the noise level 
generated near the railway tracks. The noise levels also reveal that when the distance 
between the noise source and the receiver grows, the noise measured by the receiver 
decreases, most likely owing to sound pressure loss. Sound pressure results from sound 
sources radiating sound energy into a particular acoustic environment, which is then 
measured at a specific location. The surface area surrounding a point sound source rises according to the square of the distance from the source. This implies that the same 
amount of sound energy from the source is dispersed across a greater region, and the 
intensity of the energy drops proportionately to the square of the distance from the 
source. This concept is often referred to as the inverse square law. In accordance with 
the inverse square law, the sound pressure level decreases by around 6 dB for every 
doubling of distance from a point source (Collman, 2015). 
 
This suggests that extending the distance between the noise source and the receiver 
or constructing a barrier between the noise source and the receiver will greatly lower 
the noise level received. Physical barriers, such as buildings, trees, and bushes, cause 
noise to be reflected and absorbed, reducing its level and ability to propagate. In nearly 
20% of the recorded noise measurements, the ambient noise exceeded the DOE's 60 
dBA threshold for urban residential areas (high-density areas). Fortunately, only two 
train noise measurements exceeded the DOE's allowable levels of more than 65 dBA 
for urban residential areas. These findings are shown in Appendix B.1. 

**4.2.1 Noise Level at Taipan – Wawasan LRT Station Pair** 

Table 4.1: Noise Level at Taipan – Wawasan LRT Station Pair 

Figure 4.1: Graph of Noise Level Measurement for Taipan – Wawasan  
LRT Station Pair 

Figure 4.2: Graph of Noise Level Difference for Taipan – Wawasan 
LRT Station Pair 

Table 4.1 separates the noise measurements from the Taipan - Wawasan LRT 
station into two-quadrant columns. These two columns allow us to compare noise 
levels between the two quadrants, as noise measurements for each station pair were 
taken from opposite sides of the LRT line. Using A-weighted equivalent continuous 
noise level LAeq (dBA) measurements, the noise measurement is tabulated as an 
ambience, train passing, and noise level difference based on the distance from the train 
tracks. 
 
The noise level measurements of ambience and train passing noise for both 
quadrants were plotted on the same graph, with distance (m) representing the x-axis 
and the equivalent continuous noise level LAeq (dBA) representing the y-axis as 
shown in Figure 4.1. The left side of the graph displays Quadrant 2 noise 
measurements, which someone should read from the centre to the left, and the right 
side of the graph displays Quadrant 1 noise measurements, which someone should read from the centre to the right. All noise level measurement graphs adhere to the above-
described format. 
 
Furthermore, the noise level difference was plotted as a clustered column in 
Figure 4.2, with distance (m) representing the x-axis and the equivalent continuous 
noise level LAeq (dBA) representing the y-axis. The first grey coloured bar represents 
Quadrant 1 and the second white coloured bar Quadrant 2, respectively. All noise level 
difference graphs adhere to the described format. 
 
Every 350 meters, the ambient noise level in Quadrant 1 approaches peaks and 
troughs. This noise pattern is likely a result of the area's heavy road traffic and 
numerous industries. Additionally, the noise when the train passes exhibit the same 
behaviour as the ambient noise in the quadrant. In addition, at distances of less than 
500 meters, the train's noise is consistently louder than the ambient noise. Within a 
range of 650 to 950 meters, the train's passing noise is at most 0.6 decibels (dBA) less 
than the ambient noise. This behaviour may be explained by the sound pressure loss 
of the train passing noise and the fluctuation of ambient noise from road traffic and 
industrial noises, which diminishes the train passing noise's significance. 
 
Meanwhile, in Quadrant 2, the ambience and train passing noise follow the 
same pattern, with the train passing noise being more significant than the ambience 
noise for distances less than 650 meters. The noise produced by the train is lower than 
the ambient noise by a maximum of 0.6 dBA between 500 and 950 meters. Because 
of the noise measuring point's proximity to a busy road, ambient and train passing noise reach peak levels at 650 meters. Then, both noise levels fall below 55 decibels. 
This noise reduction is most likely due to the noise measuring point being in a quiet 
and guarded residential area, which causes the noise level to drop significantly. 
 
The noise level difference is used to calculate and observe the significance of 
train passing noise versus ambient noise. The noise level difference is significant for 
distances of less than 500 meters in Quadrant 1 and 650 meters in Quadrant 2. The 
reason is that the noise level difference at 500 meters in Quadrant 1 was -0.2 dBA, 
while it was -0.6 dBA at 650 meters in Quadrant 2. These negative noise level 
difference values demonstrate that the train passing noise is insignificant compared to 
the ambient noise. According to Table 4.1, the noise level difference can exceed one 
dBA, with the highest peak value recorded being 4.3 dBA. A 1 dBA increase, for 
example, is negligible because it equates to a 26 per cent difference in sound energy 
(Moeller, 2012). However, according to IOSH (2018), a three dBA increase has a 
greater impact on hearing health. 63 dBA, for example, is twice as loud as 60 dBA. 
When considering noise exposure, the significance of this becomes clear. The noise 
level rises by 3 dB for every 3 dB increase, and the exposure time must be cut in half 
to keep people safe. Train passing noise is significant and impacts environmental noise 
up to 500 meters in Quadrant 1 and 650 meters in Quadrant 2. The train passing noise 
is insignificant over longer distances. 

**4.2.2 Noise Level at Taman Bahagia – Taman Paramount Station Pair** 

Table 4.2: Noise Level at Taman Bahagia – Taman Paramount LRT Station Pair 

Figure 4.3: Graph of Noise Level Measurement for Taman Bahagia 
– Taman Paramount LRT Station Pair 

Figure 4.4: Graph of Noise Level Difference for Taman Bahagia 
– Taman Paramount LRT Station Pair

Table 4.2 and Figure 4.3 demonstrate that the ambient noise level in Quadrant 
1 approaches peaks and troughs every 350 meters. This noise pattern is likely 
attributable to the region's heavy road traffic and commercial activities. In addition, 
the noise produced by the train exhibits the same characteristics as the ambient noise 
in the quadrant. In addition, the train's noise is consistently louder than the ambient 
noise at distances of less than 800 meters. Within 800 meters or further, the train's 
passing noise is no less than 0.2 decibels (dBA) below the ambient noise. This 
behaviour may be explained by the loss of sound pressure of the train passing noise 
and the fluctuation of ambient noise from road traffic and commercial activities, which 
diminishes the significance of the train passing noise. 
 
In Quadrant 2, ambience and train passing noise follow the same pattern, with 
the train passing noise being more noticeable than ambience noise at distances less 
than 500 meters. At 500 meters, the train's noise is lower than the ambient noise by a 
maximum of 0.3 dBA. Due to the proximity of the noise measurement point to a busy road, ambient and train passing noise peaks at 500 meters. Then, both decibel levels 
drop below 50. This noise reduction is most likely attributable to the fact that the noise 
measuring point is in a quiet residential area, causing the noise level to drop 
significantly. 
 
Figure 4.4 demonstrates that the difference in noise level is significant at 
distances of less than 800 meters in Quadrant 1 and 500 meters in Quadrant 2. The 
reason is that the noise level difference at 800 meters in Quadrant 1 was -0.2 dBA, 
while at 500 meters in Quadrant 2, it was -0.3 dBA. These negative differences in noise 
level indicate that the train passing noise is negligible compared to the ambient noise. 
According to Table 4.2, the noise level difference can exceed one decibel, with a peak 
value of 4.2 decibels recorded. Significant train passing noise impacts ambient noise 
up to 800 meters in Quadrant 1 and 500 meters in Quadrant 2. Train passing noise is 
negligible at greater distances. 

**4.2.3 Noise Level at Gombak – Taman Melati LRT Station Pair** 

Table 4.3: Noise Level at Gombak – Taman Melati
LRT Station Pair 

Figure 4.5: Graph of Noise Level Measurement for Gombak – Taman Melati 
LRT Station Pai

Figure 4.6: Graph of Noise Level Difference for Gombak – Taman Melati 
LRT Station Pair

Table 4.3 and Figure 4.5 show that ambient and train passing noise levels in 
Quadrant 1 have sharp peaks and troughs, with a peak at 350 meters, a sharp drop at 
500 meters, and a sharp increase at 800 meters. This noise pattern is most likely caused 
by heavy traffic and a quiet residential area with a park. Furthermore, at distances of 
less than 200 meters, the train's noise is slightly louder than the ambient noise. The 
train's passing noise is less than 0.1 decibels (dBA) below the ambient noise within 
200 meters. This behaviour can be explained by the loss of sound pressure caused by 
train passing noise and the fluctuation of ambient noise caused by road traffic and 
commercial activities, which reduces the significance of the train passing noise. 
 
The ambient and train passing noise levels in Quadrant 1 gradually decrease to 
less than 51 dBA at 350 meters, with peaks and troughs every 150 meters. This noise 
pattern is likely due to the region's terrain, as the noise measuring point is hidden 
behind a hill, although the equipment faces the train tracks. The presence of the hill most likely reduces the propagation of train noise. Furthermore, at distances of less 
than 650 meters, the train's noise is consistently louder than the ambient noise. The 
train's passing noise is less than 0.4 decibels (dBA) below the ambient noise within 
650 meters. This behaviour may be explained by the loss of sound pressure caused by 
the train passing noise, as well as the presence of many trees and a hilly terrain, which 
reduces the significance of the train passing noise. 

Figure 4.6 shows a significant difference in noise level at distances of less than 
200 meters in Quadrant 1 and 650 meters in Quadrant 2. The reason is that the noise 
level difference at 200 meters in Quadrant 1 was -0.1 dBA, while it was -0.4 dBA at 
650 meters in Quadrant 2. These negative noise level differences indicate that the train 
passing noise is insignificant compared to the ambient noise. The noise level difference 
can exceed one decibel, according to Table 4.2, with a peak value of 2.3 decibels 
recorded. Train passing noise impacts ambient noise up to 200 meters in Quadrant 1 
and 650 meters in Quadrant 2. At greater distances, train passing noise is negligible. 

**4.3 Noise Mapping** 

The inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method was used for noise 
mapping to generate sound contours. Interpolation is a technique to predict cell values 
at locations with insufficient data. According to Verma, Jana, and Ramamritham 
(2019), the IDW interpolation technique was chosen over other techniques because it 
is easier to set the parameters and interpret the results while maintaining performance 
comparable to other interpolation techniques. In general, spatial interpolation 
techniques use known values to estimate the values of locations with unknown values. 
IDW utilises local interpolation, which gives neighbouring points with known values 
greater weight than all access points. The inverse distance weighted can regulate the 
significance of known points, their distance from the output point, and their 
interpolated values. IDW can provide interpolated surface grid values and structures 
with precision. Numerous noise maps that investigate the impact of road and rail traffic 
noise employ this interpolation method. 
 
The noise map is colour-coded according to the noise level. The noise band of the 
colour code determines the colours used for LRT station noise maps. The colour code 
directs the chromatic noise maps. The colour will become darker as the noise level 
indicator exceeds 59.0 dBA. At or below 59.0 decibels, the colour indicator becomes 
brighter and green, indicating that the ambient noise level is safe. The orange colour 
contour in the surrounding area of the map indicates that noise can spread further away 
from the station, causing discomfort for those in the neighbourhood. The surrounding 
structure can also block low noise levels but cannot reduce the train's high-pitched noise. Only when there are no obstacles can sound travel. This research had no building 
or height restrictions, resulting in level terrain due to software limitations. 

**4.3.1 Noise Map of Taipan – Wawasan LRT Station Pair**

Figure 4.7: The noise map of Taipan – Wawasan LRT station pair 
Figure 4.7 illustrates the noise map for ambient noise and train passing noise 
at the Taipan and Wawasan LRT stations. The noise contours were mapped on the 
noise map using the IDW interpolation method. This station pair region has 
predominantly flat topography. On the right side of the LRT line, Quadrant 1 consists 
primarily of residential and industrial districts, including apartments, flats, schools, 
and small to medium-sized industries. Quadrant 2 consists primarily of residential and 
commercial districts, including two-story shop lots, two-story terrace residences, 
public parks, and a mosque. 

The only noise measurement point exceeding the acceptable ambient noise 
level of 60 dBA in Quadrant 2 is 650 meters. The reason is due to the proximity of the 
noise measurement spot to the bustling Persiaran Bakti road. Noise from vehicles may 
cause the high noise level recorded. All noise measurement stations in quadrant 1 
exceed the allowable ambient noise level of 60 decibels near the busy Persiaran 
Subang road and the USJ Industrial Area. Besides that, the build-up density, non-
existence of noise barrier, and green areas cause the noise level to be high. The train 
passing noise map demonstrates that train passing does affect the surrounding noise 
level, as the area within 200 meters of the train lines gets redder than the ambient noise 
map. The red colour contour surrounding the map indicates that the noise can spread 
further away from the station, causing inconvenience for the residents. 

**4.3.2 Noise Map of Taman Bahagia – Taman Paramount LRT Station Pair**

Figure 4.8: The noise map of Taman Bahagia – Taman Paramount LRT station pair 
Figure 4.8 depicts the noise map for ambient and train passing noise at the LRT 
station pair Taman Bahagia – Taman Paramount. The noise contours were mapped on the noise map using the IDW interpolation method. This region's landscape is 
predominantly hilly. Quadrant 1 at the top of the LRT line consists of residential and 
commercial spaces, such as storefronts and two-story homes. Quadrant 2 comprises 
residential neighbourhoods, including bungalows and two-story terrace homes, on the 
opposite side of the map.  
 
In addition, only one measurement site in quadrant 1 exceeds the permissible 
ambient noise level of 60 dBA at 650 meters due to its proximity to the SEA Park 
commercial district. In Quadrant 2, no noise measurement locations are louder than 
the acceptable ambient level. The train passing noise map indicates that passing trains 
affect the surrounding noise level, as the area within 500 meters of train tracks 
becomes more orange than the ambient noise map. The orange contour encircling the 
map indicates that the noise can travel further away from the station, causing 
discomfort among the local population. 

**4.3.3 Noise Map of Gombak – Taman Melati LRT Station Pair**

Figure 4.9: The noise map of Gombak – Taman Melati LRT station pair 
The noise map for ambient and train passing noise for the LRT station pair 
Gombak - Taman Melati is shown in Figure 4.9. The IDW interpolation method was 
used to map the noise contours onto the noise map. The topography of Quadrant 1 is 
flat, located on the lower right of the LRT line, whereas Quadrant 2 is hilly and 
mountainous, located on the upper left of the LRT line. Quadrant 1 is primarily made 
up of residential areas, including apartments, a mosque, and two-story terrace houses. 
Meanwhile, quadrant 2 is mostly made up of two-story homes and bungalows. 
 
Only one noise measurement site in Quadrant 1 exceeds the allowable ambient 
noise level of 60 dBA at 350 meters due to its proximity to the Jalan Taman Melati 8 
road. No noise measurement sites in Quadrant 2 exceed the allowable ambient level. 
The train passing noise map shows that train passing affects the surrounding noise 
level because the area within 200 meters of the train lines turns more orange than the ambient noise map. The orange colour contour around the map indicates that noise can 
travel further away from the station, causing discomfort to residents. 

**4.4 Societal, Health, and Safety Impact** 

Compared to road traffic noise, railroad noise's impact on society, health, and 
safety is a much more complicated issue. Many factors influence railroad emissions. 
The technical condition of the tracks and rolling stock, the type of brakes used, the 
volume of traffic, and the terrain of the surrounding area, for example, can all impact 
railroad noise emissions. The Klang Valley area has been subjected to constant train 
noise since the introduction of intracity train transportation in the metro area. However, 
there are two impediments to addressing the city's train noise: a lack of resources and 
a lack of political will. Introducing an LRT train into the city will impact society, 
health, and safety, which are often invisible to the naked eye as most nuisances come 
from noise and vibrations. 
 
Loud noise from trains can cause stress, high blood pressure, heart disease, and 
sleep disturbances (Muralidharan et al., 2018). In the long term, loud noise also always 
results in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). These health problems can affect people 
of all ages, not just children. Additionally, loud noises may lead to pedestrian accidents 
and injuries by making it harder to hear warning signals (World Health Organization, 
2013). Abdullah (2020), who studied the impact of the Kajang Line MRT noise on 
property prices, found that an increase in noise level by 1 dB was accompanied by a 
drop in the unit price of a property by RM 5.93/sqft. These findings show that an 
increase in noise level caused by trains could affect the property value and attractiveness. Trains vibrate in addition to making noise, but how vibration affects 
passengers beyond their discomfort is unclear. 

**4.5 Summary** 

Each noise point had six measurements. Ambient noise, train passing noise, and 
noise level difference were tabulated. The noise measurement's average standard 
deviation is 1.9 dBA, indicating it is close to the average. Nearly 20% of ambient noise 
measurements in urban residential areas exceeded 60 dBA (high-density areas). Only 
two train noise measurements exceeded the DOE's 65 dBA urban residential limit. The 
Taipan-Wawasan station pair's train noise affects the environment up to 500m in 
Quadrant 1 and 650m in Quadrant 2. Train passing affects the surrounding noise level, 
with the area within 200 meters of train lines turning redder than the ambient noise 
map. Significant train noise impacts ambient noise up to 800 meters in Quadrant 1 and 
500 meters in Quadrant 2 for Taman Bahagia - Taman Paramount. The train passing 
noise map shows that passing trains impact surrounding noise levels, as the area within 
500 meters of train tracks turns more orange than the ambient noise map. The Gombak-
Taman Melati station pair train's noise travels 200 meters in Quadrant 1 and 650 meters 
in Quadrant 2. The train passing noise map shows how train passing affects 
surrounding noise by turning the area within 200 meters of train lines more orange 
than the ambient noise map. Train noise affects health, safety, and society. 

# Chapter 5: Conclusion
**5.1 Conclusions** 

The conclusions of this project are: 
1. The train passing noise generated along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line affect the 
surrounding noise around Taipan-Wawasan station up to 500m in Quadrant 1 
and 650m in Quadrant 2, up to 800 meters in Quadrant 1 and 500 meters in 
Quadrant 2 for Taman Bahagia-Taman Paramount, and Gombak-Taman Melati 
station pair train's noise travels 200 meters in Quadrant 1 and 650 meters in 
Quadrant 2. 
 
2. From the noise map generated, train passing affects the surrounding noise level 
within 200 meters of train lines in the Taipan-Wawasan station area, turning 
redder than the ambient noise map. In contrast, 500 meters from train tracks in 
the Taman Bahagia-Taman Paramount station area turns more orange than the 
ambient noise map. Within 200 meters of train lines of Gombak-Taman Melati, 
the area turns more orange than the ambient noise map. 

**5.2 Recommendations** 

1. This method of noise mapping provides noise information for only one height, 
which is insufficient for the noise assessment process. In the future, it will be 
necessary to employ three-dimensional (3D) noise models to obtain 
comprehensive data on noise that may pose a health risk to bystanders and 
residents living near train stations.  
 
2. Future research should concentrate on gathering more noise measurements to 
obtain more accurate average readings and lower standard deviation values. 
Utilising a sound level metre with a higher degree of sensitivity is one way to 
contribute to the accuracy and consistency of noise measurements. 
 
3. Future research should also expand the study's scope to include an examination of 
the various urban rail transit choices accessible in the Greater Klang Valley Area. 
Consider Commuter Trains, Monorail, Mass Rapid Transit, and Light Rail Transit 
as examples. 

**5.3 Assessment on Implication to Society and Environment** 

Noise mapping is valuable and necessary in large cities because it allows for 
investigating the noise pollution effects of future development plans and their 
surroundings. Numerous applications exist for noise mapping, including the 
identification and quantification of populations exposed to environmental noise 
pollution, the design and evaluation of the effectiveness of environmental noise control 
measures, and the promotion of public policies for environmental noise management 
(GlobalSpec, n.d.). The DOE recommends three methods for reducing noise from trains and railroads: noise reduction at the source, transmission path changes, and 
receiver modifications.  
 
The railway alignment, the addition of a buffer zone between homes and the tracks, 
the design of viaducts, the design of trains, the types of rails used, the quality of 
construction workmanship, the addition of wheels screening or trains under-car skirts, 
the implementation of train speed limits, and the types of wheels used could all be used 
to reduce noise at the source. Building noise barriers, enclosures, trackside rail 
screening, and absorption are all ways to alter the path of the sound. Building 
orientation and the installation of sound insulation on windows and doors are examples 
of receiver modifications. 
 
The LRT station mapping for this project has allowed engineers and safety officers 
to assess noise levels and implement risk mitigation. This research also increases 
awareness of train safety, health, and safety issues. This research also promotes greater 
openness and public acceptance by fostering a broader comprehension of the evolution 
of noise mapping. In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the 
application for noise mapping might be utilised to meet the following Sustainable 
Development Goals: SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being; SDG 9 – Industry, 
Innovation, and Infrastructure; and SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities.
