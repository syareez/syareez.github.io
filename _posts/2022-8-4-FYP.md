LRT KLAV INNOVIA Kelana Jaya Line (KLTRANSIT WORDPRESS.COM)

The Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE) has set environmental noise 
limitations and regulation standards, which apply to railways and transit trains. The 
maximum noise and vibration levels must be adhered to avoid human discomfort. The 
objectives of this project are to analyse, evaluate, and map the train passing noise 
generated along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. The ambience and train passing noise 
around LRT train stations were measured with a Sound Level Meter and recorded in 
LAeq noise levels. Taipan-Wawasan, Taman Bahagia-Taman Paramount, and 
Gombak-Taman Melati were chosen as LRT train stations. Measurements were taken 
from 50 to 950 meters, with an increment of 150 meters. Noise maps were created 
using the Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) program. Train passing 
affects the surrounding noise level within 200 meters of train lines in the Taipan-
Wawasan station area, turning redder than the ambient noise map. In contrast, 500 
meters from train tracks in the Taman Bahagia-Taman Paramount station area turns 
more orange than the ambient noise map. Within 200 meters of train lines of Gombak-
Taman Melati, the area turns more orange than the ambient noise map. This noise 
mapping project is valuable and necessary because it demonstrates the impact of LRT 
train noise on the surrounding environment and enables researchers to investigate the 
noise pollution effects of future development plans and their surroundings and 
implement risk mitigation. Hence, related authorities must take steps to reduce the 
noise generated by LRT trains as recommended by the DOE. 

# Chapter 1: Introduction
**1.1 Background of Study** 

In a heavily populated metropolitan area with numerous high-rise structures, noise 
pollution has been prioritised as an environmental concern (Li, Law, & Kwok, 2008). 
The definition of noise is a disturbing sound that is particularly loud or unpleasant 
(Lexico, n.d.). Global population growth increases consumption, and an expanding 
economy contributes to noise pollution. Almost 80 percent of metropolitan traffic 
noise is generated by vehicles such as trains, automobiles, buses, and motorcycles, 
which are significant noise producers in today's environment. Throughout daily life, 
noise nuisance has been a substantial source of concern because of unwanted sound, 
including ambient noise released by industrial machine activities and modes of transit, 
such as aircraft, cars, and trains (Zambrano-Monserrate & Ruano, 2019). Since 1980, 
the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognised environmental noise pollution 
as a significant public health concern, owing to a growing understanding of the 
detrimental effects of environmental noise on human health and well-being (WHO, 
2018). 

The Klang Valley, located in the centre part of the Malaysian Peninsula's west 
coast, encompasses an area of approximately 3234 km2 (Chan & Vu, 2017). The 
region consists of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, its suburbs, and the state of 
Selangor's surrounding cities and towns. It is becoming more industrialised and 
urbanised. Due to the city's expanding population, industrial areas, transportation, and 
other man-made activities, noise pollution problems exist. The severity of the noise 
pollution issue would also intensify in the upcoming years. As a growing nation 
aspiring to be developed, Malaysia seeks to preserve its capital city, green and intends 
to rank among the world's "top 20 most liveable cities" by 2020. (Jabatan Perdana 
Menteri, 2010). 
 
As a result, to meet the objectives, the government has expanded public 
transportation services in Klang Valley by building new railway lines such as the Light 
Rail Transit (LRT). The LRT system is a rail system used to transport passengers in 
metropolitan areas. The LRT Kelana Jaya Line (Line 5, formerly known as the PUTRA 
Line), as shown in Figure 1.1, comprises 37 stops and covers 46.4 kilometers between 
Gombak and Putra Heights. Unlike conventional trains that run on diesel and coal, 
LRT trains run on electricity; hence, it has a greener emission profile.

Figure 1.1: The trains of LRT Kelana Jaya Line passing each other at the KL Sentral station (Aliff MR, 2020).

While railway transit is the most environmentally benign means of travel, it is 
unavoidable to acknowledge the noise pollution caused by trains (Shahidan, Maarof, 
Hannan, & Ali, 2017). Train noise depends on the type of train utilised, whether heavy 
or light, and the sound produced by rotation wheels on the rail tracks, contributing to 
the noise contribution (Grubliauskas et al., 2014). Grubliauskas discovered that the 
driving speed and train operation method influenced the loudness for automatic or 
manual handling. Near railway lines are residences, hospitals, and other noise-
sensitive structures. Train noise significantly degrades the quality of life for most 
residents who live in these heavily crowded cities. 
 
This project will examine the present amount of noise generated by the LRT 
Kelana Jaya Line. There is a study deficit in noise mapping for urban rail transit in 
Malaysia, notably in the Klang Valley, which could assist relevant authorities in 
implementing the noise minimization approach. The noise assessment is crucial because it is important to keep an eye on and investigate the government's acceptable 
sound level range to help with policy development for sound abatement activities (Lee 
et al., 2020).

**1.2 Problem Statement** 

Noise pollution has worsened because of the rapid growth of metropolitan regions 
and railway lines in the Klang Valley region. Malaysia operates urban rail transport 
(URT) systems such as monorails, light rail transit (LRT), and mass rapid transit 
(MRT). While these railway activities generated considerable noise as the train 
travelled along the track, they considerably reduced congestion in the Klang Valley 
area (Abdulrazza et al., 2020). Noise works as an environmental stressor, resulting in 
physiological health problems and disrupted daily activities. Excessive noise exposure 
has been demonstrated to produce discomfort, interrupt sleep, increase daily 
sleepiness, negatively impact patient outcomes and hospital staff performance, raise 
the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and reduce cognitive function in 
pupils (Basner et al., 2014). According to a study conducted in Chongqing, the noise 
at the measurement point near the light rail was over 80 dB, severely affecting the 
nearby residential buildings. The noise level was extremely high within 60 meters of 
the light rail (Zhao et al., 2020). 
 
Malaysia’s Department of Environment (DOE) has set environmental noise 
limitations and regulation standards, which apply to railways and transit trains. The 
maximum noise and vibration levels that are established must be adhered to avoid 
human discomfort. Regrettably, there has been little research on the noise level generated by URT in Malaysia. This project seeks to close this gap by measuring the 
noise generated by the LRT Kelana Jaya Line and mapping the noise data collected 
along the rail lines.

**1.3 Objectives**

The specific objectives of this project are: 
1. To analyse and evaluate the train passing noise generated along the LRT  Kelana Jaya Line;   
2. To map the train passing noise generated along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line

**1.4 Scope of Study** 

This research will focus on the noise along the LRT Kelana Jaya Line with specific 
limitations, namely: 
1. Focusing only on the noise emitted from the above-ground portion of the LRT 
Kelana Jaya Line, which includes at-grade and elevated railway tracks; and 
2. Focusing only on areas 950 meters on either side of the LRT Kelana Jaya Line 
3. During the experiment, the ambient sounds of automobiles, construction 
equipment, aeroplanes, and emergency sirens were disregarded. 

**1.5 Thesis Outline** 

This undergraduate thesis is divided into five chapters: an overview of past research, 
a literature review, methodology, results and discussion, and a conclusion. The first 
chapter, Chapter 1, will introduce the project’s background study, the problem 
statement, objectives, and scope of the study. Chapter 2 will review previous research 
on environmental noise, urban rail transit noise, and noise mapping. The methodology 
of this project, as well as the flow of the method used to complete the project, will be 
detailed in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contains the study’s results and analysis, which had 
been addressed and analysed considering the study’s objectives. The final chapter, 
Chapter 5, will conclude the entire study based on the results and whether the objective 
was met. Recommendations for further research on the topic will be made. This 
project’s societal and environmental implications will also be discussed. 

# Chapter 2: Literature Review
**2.1 General Noise** 

In acoustics, electronics, and physics, sound and noise are used interchangeably, 
although they have distinct implications when applied to listeners. Sound is vibrations 
that travel through the air or another medium and are audible when they reach the ear 
of a person or animal (Lexico, n.d.). Meanwhile, the definition of noise is an audible 
disturbance that is exceptionally loud or unpleasant. (Lexico, n.d.). Meanwhile, in 
engineering, noise also refers to signals that change without significance over time, 
whereas sound refers to meaningful signals (Fink, 2019). Noise is measured in decibels 
on a logarithmic scale. Typical noise levels in daily life include 40 dB, which 
corresponds to a whisper at 30 cm, and 100 dB, which corresponds to the sound of a 
propeller plane at 30 meters. A gain of 1 decibel is detectable, while a gain of 10 
decibels doubles the perceived noise level. Figure 2.1 shows the typical sound level on 
the dBA scale (US OSHA, 1995). 

Figure 2.1: The typical sound level on the dBA scale (US OSHA, 1995). 
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2019), exposure 
to noise levels more than 70 decibels over an extended length of time may cause 
hearing loss. Extremely loud noises exceeding 120 decibels might cause acute ear 
damage. Otherwise, personal protective equipment such as earplugs or earmuffs were 
worn to minimise noise exposure. In Malaysia, very few studies and research have 
been conducted about noise pollution. This is because knowledge of noise pollution 
remains below average. Malaysia's progress towards becoming a developed nation by 
2020 has not, however, been devoid of environmental issues. The community's noise 
level has increased because of the community's population growth and socioeconomic 
developments. 

**2.2 Environmental Noise** 

In Malaysia, there are two main forms of noise: ambient noise and occupational 
noise. Community noise and noise irritation are connected to environmental noise 
(Leung et al., 2017; Segaran et al., 2020), while occupational noise is associated with 
noise exposure in the workplace (Jacquelyne AB et al., 2020; Abu Mansor et al., 2020). 
Noise pollution is sometimes overlooked since it cannot be seen or tasted, despite 
having negative impacts. The decibel (dB) is the environmental noise pollution unit, 
used to measure sound power, sound intensity, and sound pressure level (Kumar & 
Kumar, 2018). The Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE), Ministry of Water 
and Environment, Malaysian Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH), 
and Ministry of Human Resources are accountable for environmental and occupational 
noise. 
 
Due to the ambient noise generated by the presence of numerous people in one 
location, an urban setting is rarely fully silent (von Graevenitz, 2018). In accordance 
with Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG-11) on sustainable cities and 
communities, there is a need to investigate noise pollution in Malaysia, particularly in 
the vicinity of urban rail transit. Monitoring transportation noise for up-to-date and 
accurate information on environmental noise is essential for noise pollution 
enforcement and policy creation. The Malaysian authority stated that any train 
operation should comply with the released guidelines that need to be followed; which 
is in the range of 50 dB to 80 dB with respect to two periods; day and night (DOE, 
2019), as can be referred to in Table 2.1.  

Table 2.1: Limiting Sound Level (LAeq) for Railways Including Transits (For New 
Development and Re-Alignments) (DOE, 2019) 

| Receiving Land Use Category                         | Day Time (7.00 a.m. – 10.00 p.m.) | Night Time (10.00 p.m.– 7.00 a.m.) | Lmax (Day & Night) |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Noise Sensitive Areas Low Density Residential Areas | 60 dBA                            | 50 dBA                             | 75 dBA             |
| Suburban and Urban Residential Areas                | 65 dBA                            | 60 dBA                             | 80 dBA             |
| Commercial, Business                                | 70 dBA                            | 65 dBA                             | 80 dBA             |
| Industrial                                          | 75 dBA                            | 65 dBA                             | NA                 |

Excessive noise is defined by the Noise Exposure Regulations as a daily noise 
exposure level above 82 dB(A), a daily personal noise dosage exceeding fifty percent, 
a maximum sound pressure level exceeding 115 dB(A) at any time, or a peak sound 
pressure level surpassing 140 dB (C) (DOSH, 2019). The A-weighted Leq sound level 
is represented by dB (A), also known as decibels (A). In many applications, A-
weighting is the conventional name for A frequency-weighted sound level 
measurement over the whole audio range that correlates well with perceived loudness. 
Meanwhile, Leq is the time-averaged sound level (LAT), the sound level in decibels 
with the same total sound energy as the observed fluctuation level. A C or flat 
frequency weighting can be used to measure the peak. Using the A curve adds its time 
constant, making True Peak measurement impossible. The C-weighted peak sound 
level is given in dB as LCpeak (C). C-weighting is utilised for high-level 
measurements and peak sound pressure levels. The A-weighting curve is commonly employed for general noise measurements; however, the C-weighting curve 
corresponds with human responses to high noise levels better. (Gracey, 2021).

**2.3 Impact of Environmental Noise Pollution** 

Noise has become one of the most significant pollutants in modern cities, although 
the danger is sometimes neglected. Noise functions as an environmental stressor, 
causing physiological health difficulties that might interfere with everyday activities 
and communications. Excessive noise exposure has been linked to discomfort, sleep 
disruption, daytime drowsiness, poor patient outcomes and staff performance in 
hospitals, an increase in the prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, 
and worse cognitive performance in schoolchildren (Basner et al., 2014). The WHO 
has addressed environmental noise pollution as a public health concern since 1980, 
owing to a rising knowledge of the effects that exposure to environmental noise has 
on human health and welfare (WHO, 2018). According to recent research in Spain, 
noise pollution has surpassed air pollution as the biggest environmental risk factor in 
Barcelona (Mueller et al., 2017). 

**2.4 Urban Rail Transport in Klang Valley** 

Malaysia is on its way to become a modern country. Public transportation is one 
of the variables that might influence this condition. To fulfil this purpose, the 
Malaysian government has established and extended public rail transportation systems 
such as MRT, LRT, monorail, commuter, and Malayan Railways Limited (KTMB). 
The Klang Valley now features Malaysia's most comprehensive rail transit system, 
which will serve as the future backbone of a transportation network that delivers an efficient, dependable, economical, and environmentally friendly travel option (Kwan 
et al., 2017). As shown in Figure 2.2, nine train lines are currently being operated in 
the Klang Valley, with two upcoming train lines (MRT Putrajaya Line and LRT Shah 
Alam Line).  

Figure 2.2: Klang Valley Integrated Transit Map (Rapid KL, 2021) 

The Light Rail Transit (LRT) system is a rail system used to transport passengers 
in metropolitan areas. This research focuses on the Kelana Jaya Line LRT. The LRT 
Kelana Jaya Line is highlighted with yellow colour in Figure 2.2. The LRT Kelana 
Jaya Line (Line 5, formerly known as the PUTRA Line) comprises 37 stops and covers 
46.4 kilometers between Gombak and Putra Heights. As shown in Figure 2.3, the full 
route of the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. Malaysian authorities initially constructed the line 
in 1998 and extended it in 2016 owing to the city’s severely grid-locked highways. 
The Kelana Jaya Line transports around 329,406 passengers every day as it is one of 
the most established rail lines in the Klang Valley, contributing the highest ridership 
among all the lines (MOT, 2019). Furthermore, the LRT rail line significantly 
integrates the rail networks in Malaysia and is expected to mitigate the intense traffic 
congestion in those concerned areas. 

Figure 2.3: LRT Kelana Jaya Line route map (klia2.info, n.d.). 

**2.5 Impact of Urban Rail Transport Noise Pollution** 

Rail is often regarded as one of the most ecologically benign modes of 
transportation, having the capacity to operate with significantly reduced emission levels. However, in recent decades, it has surpassed road traffic noise as the second 
most significant form of environmental noise pollution in Europe, trailing only air 
traffic and industrial noise. An estimated 22 million individuals in Europe are exposed 
to railway noise levels of at least 55 dB(A), with 17 million exposed to levels of at 
least 50 dB(A) (Peris, 2020). Railway noise is a significant source of annoyance for 
residents living near railway tracks (Shahidan et al., 2017). According to a study 
conducted in Chongqing, the noise at the measurement point near the light rail was 
over 80 dB, severely affecting the nearby residential buildings. The noise level was 
extremely high within 60 meters of the light rail (Zhao et al., 2020). In addition, 
Muralidharan et al. (2018) found that students who live near the Bhandup railway 
station do not get enough sleep and are stressed out. 

**2.6 Noise Level Before LRT Construction** 

Previously, a study done by Yaakup et al. (2000) observed that during the years 
1998–1999, 31 percent of the region in Kuala Lumpur and Klang had a great increment 
level of generated noise as compared to 13 percent of the trend for the stated area not 
to encounter the loudness. Nevertheless, over 50 percent of the entire region is still 
maintained below the noise level, where the rural areas contribute to less noise 
production. Two factors resulting in expanding noise levels are high traffic volume 
and little effort in tree plantations. In their research, Elfaig et al. (2014) have stated 
that residential areas at Jalan Tong Shin, Bukit Bintang have been examined for noise 
quality assessment in the urban city. Noise levels recorded by Sound Level Meter 
(SLM) Type One in 2013 have measured the loudness reading within the range of 52.1 
dBA to 72.7 dBA. Noise pollution in those areas is caused by traffic volume, consisting of transportation systems and motor vehicles used, which is associated with poor urban 
planning.

Halim et al. (2017) reported that residential locations at Desa Tun Razak, Kinrara 
Court, and Taman Sentul Utama have sensed the noise reading at 75.7 dB, 74.3 dB 
and 72.1 dB accordingly. The condition happened due to severe noise pollution in 
urbanised and industrialised locations, which affected the community as it exceeded 
the permissible noise limit set by the Department of Environment. Furthermore, in 
2005, three residential areas in Bandar Sunway, Kelana Jaya, and Taman Megah in 
Petaling Jaya were selected by a researcher to measure sound in the daytime, which 
resulted in a maximum reading of 67 dB, 70 dB, and 72 dB (Yusoff & Ishak, 2005). 
The reason for having a high noise caused by traffic volume along highways in the 
sense of vehicle types used has been worsened by insufficient sound barriers due to 
specification and method usage issues to reduce the enhanced noise. 

**2.7 Noise Mapping** 

Noise mapping is graphical information to visualise the sound level with different 
colours to provide helpful information on environmental impact (Alam et al., 2017). 
The dark colour indicates a higher sound level, while the brighter colour represents a 
smaller number of decibels. The shades indicate the varying sound levels for a certain 
period addressed in urban territories (Vasilyev, 2017). Noise mapping is a valuable 
tool for delivering meaningful global and local action strategies (Klæboe et al., 2006), 
and critical points can be detected (Najah et al., 2019). As claimed by (Z. Qin & Y. 
Zhu., 2016), mapping the noise is one method to alleviate noise pollution where it has already become a severe threat to people, especially those living in big cities. Figure 
2.4 shows the noise map of the Relau residential neighbourhood, Penang, Malaysia 
(Lee et al., 2020) as an example of a noise map. 
Figure 2.4: The noise map of Relau residential neighbourhood, Penang, Malaysia. 
(a) noise map in daytime, and (b) noise map in evening. (Lee et al., 2020) 
 
As agreed by a study (Tsai et al., 2009), mapping has emerged as a powerful platform 
to demonstrate noise distribution. Tsai used this effective method to identify whether 
selected areas have disobeyed the current regulatory standard or vice versa, which 
needs to be reevaluated and necessary for further noise improvement. Thus, this 
method is done to avoid any severe effects, or else the standard itself needs to be 
reexamined in the sense of adequate input level. Alarming noise levels were 
discovered along urban rail transport tracks on noise maps in a prior study by Manoj 
Kumar et al. (2019), prompting suggestions for immediate noise reduction measures 
such as noise barriers. 

**2.8 Summary** 

This chapter defines general noise, its units, and the effects of long-term exposure 
to loud noise. The chapter discusses noise, including both ambient and occupational 
noise. It is described in greater detail to focus on environmental noise. This chapter 
also addressed the noise guidelines established by the authorities, covered standard 
noise measurement parameters, and then looked at the effects of noise pollution. Most 
of the impact is hazardous to one's health and causes disruptions. Urban rail transport 
in the Klang Valley, where public train systems are expanding, is also discussed. The 
study's train route was also discussed in this chapter. The following section of this 
chapter discusses the effect of urban rail noise pollution on railway noise. The railway 
noise is a significant source of annoyance and health risks. Before construction, there 
was enough noise to be concerned about how the LRT's operation would affect the 
surrounding area. The impact of urban rail transportation noise on this study will be 
assessed using noise mapping. 

# Chapter 3: Methodology
**3.1 Overview** 

This chapter describes the approach chosen to conduct this study regarding 
research flow, site location, and research instrument. Following a review of various 
past research projects, the technique and study approach for conducting the project 
was developed and outlined. This chapter also goes over data collection and data 
analysis. 
 
**3.2 Flow Chart** 

The research flow chart is depicted in Figure 3.1. The flow chart provides a 
concise explanation from the start of the study to a decisive conclusion. The problem 
statement identifies the organised specifics on how to conduct the study so that the 
research does not diverge from the initial purpose. 

Figure 3.1: The research flow chart

**3.3 Research Approach** 

**3.3.1 Research Flow** 

According to Figure 3.1, the research flow begins with conducting a literature 
review on studies linked to this subject. A literature review is essential since it aids in 
identifying and concentrating on issues that have not yet been researched previously 
and selecting the most appropriate technique and method for doing the study. 
Following that, before delving deeper into the project, it is necessary to address the 
project problem statements and objectives before beginning the project. It guarantees 
that the project remains on track and does not deviate from its original course. As a 
result, a pilot test was designed to simulate the entire and comprehensive data 
collection. This strategy aids in the analysis and improvement of the flaws that the 
researcher encountered throughout the whole data collection process. Based on the 
encountered issues, finalised measured parameters and variables were established to 
make data collecting easier. After that, a thorough data collection process was 
conducted. The measured and recorded noise data were subjected to further 
examination. The researcher utilised the noise data for noise mapping. Consider the 
following scenario: the objectives are not addressed after the analysis. In that situation, 
the data-gathering process will be repeated with modifications to the parameters and 
variables to reach the desired result. After then, if the objectives are met, the outcomes 
are reported. 

**3.3.2 Site Location** 

This research is focused on the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. The LRT is well-known 
and serves as the primary urban rail transportation line in the greater Klang Valley 
area. It is a popular means of transportation for commuters in Kuala Lumpur. The 
service is an alternative to driving, which can be congested at times (MOT, 2019). 
Figures 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 depict the locations of the train stations involved in the data 
collection for this research.

Figure 3.2: Taipan–Wawasan LRT station pair 

Figure 3.3: Taman Bahagia–Taman Paramount LRT station pair

Figure 3.4: Gombak–Taman Melati LRT station pair 
 
 The first station is the Taipan–Wawasan station pair, the second, the Taman 
Bahagia–Taman Paramount stations pair, and lastly, the Gombak–Taman Melati 
stations pair. This research chose these stations because they are close to the residential 
areas. Residents must know the maximum amount of noise they are exposed to avoid 
further harm to their health (Azeez et al., 2005). Noise monitoring is avoided within a 
500-meter radius of an LRT station because no research has been conducted in 
Malaysia on the effect of noise levels on inhabitants living along the rail line. The 
research on noise levels along the rail line is critical. Noise and vibration caused by 
increasing train movements, prolonged rail operating hours, and development along 
transportation corridors have a negative impact on rail line inhabitants (EPA NSW, 
2013). The data collection points for each station pair have also been identified with 
their respective coordinates. 

**3.3.3 Noise measuring parameters** 

The noise levels of the ambience and when the train passes around the LRT train 
stations were collected and analysed in LAeq noise levels. Noise levels rise as a train 
arrives and fall as it passes, resulting in short-term changes in noise levels (Selamat & 
Rahim, 2018). The noise levels LAeq were measured following the Occupational 
Safety and Health (Noise Exposure) Regulations 2019 (DOSH, 2019). The radius 
range of noise data from the LRT train stations pair were measured at 50 meters, 200 
meters, 350 meters, 500 meters, 650 meters, 800 meters, and 950 meters. The noise 
levels were measured for one minute, then this study calculated the average noise 
findings after collecting data at the exact location three (3) times to achieve a better and more precise value. The noise data was collected during the day, between 7:00 
a.m. and 7:00 p.m., considering that the most active hours have the most significant 
impact on the noise level. On the other hand, nighttime would not ultimately provide 
considerable value in noise reading. People usually go back to their homes after 
working long hours and going to events outside their homes (Abdullah, 2020).

**3.4 Data Collection** 

For this study, a SLM from SVANTEK Model 971 was used to measure the 
LAeq along the specified stretch of the LRT Kelana Jaya Line, as shown in Figure 3.5. 
This research equipment was chosen as an instrument owned by the Department of 
Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra 
Malaysia (UPM), to compute noise measurement accurately. An acoustic 
measurement can be made using SLM to analyse sound levels based on the sound 
pressure collected from the noise source (NTI, 2018). The specs of the Svantek Model 
971 SLM used to measure and record train noise are shown in Table 3.1. 

Figure 3.5: Sound Level Meter (Svantek Model 971) (Svantek, 2020)

Table 3.1: The specifications of the Svantek Model 971 SLM (Svantek, 2020) 

Aside from that, the benefits of employing SLM are that it is portable, allowing 
for better handling while measuring noise. (Das et al., 2019). Furthermore, (Pathak et 
al., 2008) stated in their research that the SLM could measure sound like that of the 
human ear, hence contributing to the consistent noise level assessment. A calibrated 
sound level meter is essential for confirming any computation to get an accurate 
measurement and conform to the standard in question (Dwisetyo et al., 2021). So, this 
SLM had been calibrated before collecting data to ensure that the measurements were 
correct. 
 
According to the DOE (2019), the microphone placements for detecting train 
noise levels must be at least 1.2 meters above the ground and at least 3.5 meters away 
from any reflecting surfaces other than the ground. The microphone must be positioned 
to respond to incident sounds from rail tracks or viaducts. As shown in Figure 3.6, the 
SLM was set on a tripod per the guidelines stated by the DOE to produce a uniform 
reading in the vertical range. The windscreen that came with the SLM was used to 
keep noise levels from being affected by the wind. Extraneous noise events at the measurement location that is non-train related were identified and recorded as events 
that may have influenced the measured noise levels.

**3.5 Data Analysis and Mapping** 

After collecting the raw data from the noise measurement, data analysis was 
performed to convert the information into noise contour mapping activity. A noise map 
depicts the distribution of sound levels and the propagation of sound waves in a 
specific area over time. Noise maps allow for the study of the status of the noise 
pollution problem and are also helpful in determining the success of noise abatement 
methods. Different colours from the map's colour contour are employed (dB) to depict 
the LRT's noise bands (Sommerhoff et al., 2004). The colour indicator becomes darker 
as the noise value increases; hence, a lower noise value shows a brighter colour code, 
corresponding to a lower sound reading in decibel units (Selamat & Rahim, 2018). The 
colour code in Table 3.2 serves as a guide for the coloured noise maps. The colour will 
darken as the noise level sign rises above 55 decibels (dB). Meanwhile, the colour indicator becomes brighter and greener for 55 dB or less noise levels, showing that the 
surrounding noise level is safe.

This project utitlised the Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) to 
provide users with an interactive visualisation. Aside from that, this application offers 
good imagination for researchers to sketch parameters on the map coordinates based 
on the actual site engaged in their research field. The QGIS programme proved to be 
a helpful tool for making maps from geographical and non-spatial data. Because it is 
user-friendly and open-source, QGIS is an effective tool for creating noise maps (Vilas 
et al., 2018).
